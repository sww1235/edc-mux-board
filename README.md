# EDC-MUX-Board

This is part of the [EDC harness
project](https://github.com/sww1235/edc-harness) and provides power routing,
audio and PTT routing and control routing.

Contains a Raspberry Pi 3 compute stick running headless which allows for
scripting support, android app based control, as well as integrating additional
physical control panels. Will also potentially allow for audio priority ducking
via the [mixer](https://github.com/sww1235/portable-line-mixer).
