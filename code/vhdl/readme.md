# VHDL Code

This is the VHDL code for the EDC Mux project. It incorporates a 32 x 32 channel
digital mixer with I2S interfaces, some control logic for attached devices, and
an I2C slave interface for control.

Currently hoping to fit it inside a 10CL040 cyclone 10 and ideally don't want to
go higher than a 10CL055.
